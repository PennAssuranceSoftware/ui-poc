Account View?
  -- link multiple policies together

Policy View
  -- view contract values
  -- link to owner details, insured details, etc.

Money Handling View
  -- Suspense

Work Queues assigned to users?
  -- Look at money that has been in suspense for a long time
  -- Look at payments that have been "rejected"
  -- Review transactions that need approval
  
Top and Side Menus
  -- How are they controlled?  what "plugins" change/add to the menu
  -- Should those menus be "context" sensitive?  or should each page have its own menu section to work with?
     ** I'm leaning towards each page having its own...I think it's a little more user friendly

Top
  -- Notfications and Messages
  -- Another other alerts like new reports available or approvals required
  -- Search bar at the top; simple like Google Search
  -- I'm thinking of hiding or removing the actions button; can't think of anything good to do with it

Multiple things open...should the app allow for multiple things to be open...maybe only when doing something "new" like GMail...
or keep it simple like GitHub...def need to be able to save work before complete  

====================================================
UI will have Views defined throughout the application
UI will also have Controllers defined throughout the application
   -- how do we add new controllers...how to extend existing controllers?
   -- how do we add new views...how do we extends existing views?
Modules can hold multiple controller definitions
   -- Modules can depend on other modules
Routes define the views and controllers to use
  -- Use states instead of routes apparently


Need a way to dynamically load JS that can add to the states, views, and controllers that are available

====================================================

Owner, Insured, Payor
